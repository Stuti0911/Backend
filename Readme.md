Hello! I'm excited to share my first project with you. It's basic, but I'm proud to say that I've implemented JWT Tokens for secure login. I've honed my skills in Node.js, Mongoose (for the database), and various dependency libraries such as bycrypt, multer (for file uploading), and cloudinary (for image storage), among others.
